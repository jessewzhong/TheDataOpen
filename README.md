## Topic / Task Statement: Renewable Energy Sources
"Your goal is to analyze the provided datasets -- and possibly in combination with external data -- 
and explore hypotheses concerning the datasets you deem relevant. You should strive to reach a 
proposition with interesting findings that supports and/or furthers the understanding of how various 
factors influence the energy industry today"

## Abstract
With the world growing increasingly alarmed at the impact that emissions have on the global 
environment and the mounting evidence of climate change, countries have started committing
to decreasing carbon emissions and finding ways to shift to cleaner energy. Within the United
States, many states have shifted from using coal or natural gas to renewable sources such as
hydroelectric, solar, and wind energy, and the global renewable energy market is expected
to reach record high market demand in the decade to come.
However, one of the key issues is whether it is profitable for businesses to create power plants
that rely renewable resources, and whether or not the current supply and demand make such
businesses viable. Thus, our topic question is: **What can we discover about the market
potential of renewable resources within the United States?**
